# Recipe Website using ES6, npm, Babel and Webpack

Using Javascript, API's and AJAX, you can search over one million recipes. When you find a recipe that you want to keep for later, you can like it and it will be saved in localStorage for you. You can remove it from your likes too once you've tried it!
